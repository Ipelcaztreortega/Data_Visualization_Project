Starcraft Data

For our data set, we chose the real-time strategy game StarCraft. The original data includes information on the gameplay performance of over 3000 players (but for our data set, we dropped it down to roughly 300- 339 players), including their information such as age, rank, and amount of time played. We chose this data set because we believed we could properly analyze the relationship between gaming performance (rank) and other factors, such as age, hours spent per week, or total time played. 
The dataset includes a total of 20 columns (but we only chose to use LeagueIndex which is the rank, Age, HoursPerWeek, and TotalHours) which are described as follows:
LeagueIndex: The ranking of the player's league in that game
Age: The age of the player
HoursPerWeek: Number of hours per week the player spends playing the game
TotalHours: Total number of hours the player has played the game
We took the standard deviation, mean, variance, and median of Age, HoursPerWeek, and LeagueIndex to see the raw information from each across the 300+ players. The results showed that the mean age of players is around 22 years old, with a standard deviation of 4.2 years, a variance of 20, and a median being 22.  The mean number of hours played per week is around 15.9 hours, with a standard deviation of 11.0 hours, a median of 12 hours, and a variance of 116 hours. The league index had around 4.2 for the mean, with a standard deviation of 1.5, a variance of 2.1, and a median of 4.
Now from the data set and the selected columns, my group and I created 5 plots, a line chart, two bar graphs, a scatter plot, and a histogram. 
The line graph shows the correlation between the mean LeagueIndex(y-axis) for players of each Age(x-axis). There is a weak negative correlation between age and league index, and this graph shows that trend. The graph shows that the younger the player, the higher the rank, but since there is a lot of variability in the data the correlation is proven weak. 
The first bar graph shows the mean HoursPerWeek (y-axis) spent playing the game for players of each Age(x-axis). The graph suggests that players in their 20s and early 30s tend to play the game more than players in other age groups. There is a lot of variability in the data, and this graph only shows the mean hours per week for each age group, so it doesn't provide a complete picture of the relationship between age and hours per week in the dataset. The second bar graph creates a bar graph that shows the correlation between Age and the mean LeagueIndex of players in the dataset, providing insights into how LeagueIndex may vary with age. The plot shows that there is a general positive correlation between age and mean LeagueIndex, with the average LeagueIndex increasing as age increases. The graph shows that the relationship is not perfectly linear, and there is some variability in the data as it fluctuates up and down a bit around some ages. The plot does not show the full distribution of LeagueIndex values for each age group, only the mean value because my group found that graphing it in a bar graph would be best for the mean.  The reason for there being 2 bar graphs, is to show that there is a correlation between the HoursPerWeek, Age, and LeagueIndex. There is a correlation that as the younger the age, the more hours per week played, which also shows that the rank is higher in those who are younger and played more. 
The scatter plot shows that younger players (15-18) tend to have lower total hours played compared to older players, who tend to have higher total hours played. However, it is important to note that the relationship between total hours played and age is not perfectly linear, and there is a fair amount of variation in the data. This means that while older players tend to have played the game for longer hours than younger players, there are still many older players who have played the game for relatively fewer hours, and vice versa. Overall, the scatter plot suggests that age may be a factor that influences the total hours played by SkillCraft players, but other factors may also play a role in determining gameplay patterns. 
The histogram shows the distribution of values in the Age column as the x-axis and HoursPerWeek column as the y-axis. From the histogram, we can see that the negative correlation reveals that the younger the age the more hours per week played. There are also many more people playing up to 100 hours per week than expected.
The reason we chose to use this dataset to create these charts is so that we can derive some useful information and provide some insight into why a dataset like this might be used.	Overall, the SkillCraft1 dataset is a valuable resource for anyone interested in exploring the relationship between player behavior, demographics, and gameplay performance in the context of real-time strategy games.
