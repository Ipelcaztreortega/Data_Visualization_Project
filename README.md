Data Visualization Group Project

Using Python and a data set CSV file, me and a group of peers would use Python, along with the Panda's, Matplotlib, and Numpy modules and libraries to clean up and interpret the vast amount of data that was chosen. 

The data would be interpreted to show the data in six different visualized charts that spanned from bar graphs, histograms, scatterplot, and line graphs.
